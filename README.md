# paste-image package

A package for the atom editor that supports pasting images

Will save the image next to the current file and put a markdown image link into the file.

Currently the hot-key is CTRL-ALT-O

Todo:

- [ ] Fix UI to get focus automatically
- [ ] Make file placement policy configurable in UI, i.e. next to file or in subfolder.
- [ ] Make dialog visually stand out a bit more.
- [ ] Deal with failure, e.g. no image in clipboard or current editor not associated with filesystem location
